Thesis Format and Design Guideline taken from Academic Regulation Section in https://www.dcu.ie/registry/postgraduate-research-academic-regulations-guidelines-registry




9.4 Thesis	Design	and	Layout

9.4.1 The language of the thesis shall normally be either English or Irish. Where it is proposed that the thesis will be in another language, the Principal Supervisor must seek the approval of the Graduate Research Studies Board - providing details of the rationale – ideally at initial registration or prior to the student’s first annual progress review.

9.4.2 A thesis should not be excessively long. The maximum limit for a doctoral
thesis is 90,000 words of text, including bibliography and notes and, for a
Master's thesis, is 45,000 words of text, including bibliography and notes. In the case of scientific and technological theses, the amount of text may be less.
Because of this variation from subject to subject, the advice of the supervisor
should be sought at an early stage in the preparation of the thesis. For
professional doctorates, the acceptable word length should fall between the
parameters of a Master’s thesis and a doctoral thesis, and is a matter for
discussion between the supervisor and the student.

9.4.3 The use of external professional individuals or organisations for proofreading or copy-editing of theses on a paid basis is not permitted.

9.4.4 The thesis shall:
(a) Be bound within boards of sufficient rigidity to support the work when it is
standing upon a shelf. The colour of the boards shall be University blue (Pantone
Ref: 289);
(b) Have the following information on the front (board) cover:
(i) the title of the thesis in at least 24pt (8 mm) type;
(ii) the name of the candidate;
(iii)the award for which the thesis is submitted e.g. MA, MBS, LLM, MSc, MEng,
MPhil, EdD, DProfElite, DPsych, DBA, DMusPerf, PhD; and
(iv) the year of submission, i.e. the calendar year in which the Faculty Awards
Board approves the award.
(v) Where the format of the thesis includes a creative or performance piece,
the assessed practice must be recorded in an appropriate digital format as a
permanent record and be appended to the thesis.
The subject area must not be stated; the reference should be to, for example, ‘PhD’,
not ‘PhD in xxxx’.
(c) Have the following information on the spine (board) cover:
The same information (excluding the title of the thesis) shall be printed in
the same order in at least 24 pt (8 mm) type along the spine of the cover in
such a way as to be easily legible when the thesis is lying flat with its front
cover uppermost. All lettering on the cover and the spine shall be gold in
colour and clear of any graphic design.
(d) The thesis must contain a title page with the following information:

(i) the full title of the thesis, and subtitle, if any, the name of the candidate
and his/her qualifications;
(ii) the award for which the work is submitted;
(iii) the name of the University, the supervisor(s) and of the School with
which the candidate is registered;
(iv) the name and affiliation of external supervisors (if any);
(v) the month and year of submission (relevant to softbound thesis
submission at examination stage and then updated for final hardbound
thesis submission); and
(vi) the total number of volumes and the number of the particular volume,
if there is more than one volume.
(e) Declaration Page:
The thesis must have a page, bound into the thesis immediately following
the title page, containing the following declaration, signed by the candidate:
I hereby certify that this material, which I now submit for assessment on the
programme of study leading to the award of ........................... (insert
title of degree for which registered) is entirely my own work, and that I have
exercised reasonable care to ensure that the work is original, and does not to
the best of my knowledge breach any law of copyright, and has not been
taken from the work of others save and to the extent that such work has
been cited and acknowledged within the text of my work.
